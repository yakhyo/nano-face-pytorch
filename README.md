Tiny-Face is an ultra-lightweight face detection model optimized for mobile and edge devices. Built upon the concepts of RetinaFace, this model achieves high precision and speed in face detection with minimal resource requirements.

> **Note**  
> This repository refines lightweight architectures like RetinaFace (mobile), Slim and RFB with a focus on Tiny-level efficiency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yakhyo/tiny-face-pytorch.git
   cd tiny-face-pytorch
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìÇ Dataset Setup

1. **Download the Dataset**:

   - Download the [WIDERFACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/WiderFace_Results.html) dataset.
   - Download annotations (face bounding boxes & five facial landmarks) from [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Laby0EctfuJGgGMgRRgykA) (password: `fstq`) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7j70r3eeepe4r2g/retinaface_gt_v1.1.zip?dl=0).

2. **Organize the Dataset Directory**:

   Structure your dataset directory as follows:

   ```
   data/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widerface/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ label.txt
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ val/
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wider_val.txt
   ```

> [!NOTE]  
> `wider_val.txt` only includes val file names but not label information.

There is also an organized dataset (as shown above): Link from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11UGV3nbVv1x9IC--_tK3Uxf7hA6rlbsS) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIp9t30oYivrAvrgUgIoLQ) _(password: ruck)_. Thanks to [biubug6](https://github.com/biubug6) for the organized dataset.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

To train a model, specify the network backbone:

```bash
python train.py --network slim  # Replace 'slim' with your choice of model
```

**Available Models**:

- `retinaface`
- `slim`
- `rfb`

### üìä Inference

Inference the model using:

```bash
python detect.py --network retinaface --weights weights/retinaface.pth
                           slim                 weights/slim.pth
                           rfb                  weights/rfb.pth
```

#### Model found following number of faces from large selfi image:

- **RetinaFace**: 459
- **RFB**: 430
- **Slim**: 384

## üß™ Evaluating RetinaFace on WiderFace Dataset

### 1. Get and Install WiderFace Evaluation Tool

1. Clone the WiderFace evaluation repository inside the `tiny-face-pytorch` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yakhyo/widerface_evaluation
   ```
2. Navigate to the `widerface_evaluation` folder and build the required extension:
   ```bash
   cd widerface_evaluation
   python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
   ```
3. Return to the `tiny-face-pytorch` folder after installation is complete:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

### 2. Generate Predictions

Run the following command to evaluate your model with WiderFace, specifying the model architecture (`mobilenetv1_0.25` in this example) and the path to the trained weights. Predictions will be stored in `widerface_txt` inside the `widerface_evaluation` folder.

```bash
python evaluate_widerface.py --network retinaface --weights weights/retinaface.pth
                                       slim                 weights/slim.pth
                                       rfb                  weights/rfb.pth
```

### 3. Run the Final Evaluation

After generating predictions, navigate to the widerface_evaluation folder and run the following command to compare predictions with the ground truth annotations:

```bash
cd widerface_evaluation
python evaluation.py -p widerface_txt -g ground_truth
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Ensure `ground_truth` is the path to the WiderFace ground truth directory.

This will begin the evaluation process of your model on the WiderFace dataset.
